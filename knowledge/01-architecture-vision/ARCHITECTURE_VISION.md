# Architecture Vision

**TOGAF ADM Phase A — Architecture Vision**
**Status:** Draft for architecture board review · **Version:** 1.0 · 2026-07-14
**Owner:** Office of the AI Solutions Architect
**Related:** [PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md) · [VigilRAG_AUDIT.md](../VigilRAG_AUDIT.md)

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the scope, stakeholders, constraints, and desired end-state for the VigilRAG architecture engagement, per TOGAF ADM Phase A. It is the entry point that authorizes the subsequent business, data, application, and technology architecture work in this knowledge base.

## 2. Architecture engagement context

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Business driver | Enterprise knowledge fragmentation is costing measurable productivity and blocking safe AI-agent adoption (see [Problem Statement §2](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#2-problem-statement)) |
| Scope | A single knowledge retrieval and reasoning platform (VigilRAG), covering business, data, application, and technology architecture through initial enterprise pilot |
| Out of architecture scope | Redesign or replacement of source-of-record systems (code hosting, wikis, databases) — VigilRAG is a layer above them, not a replacement for them |
| Sponsoring organization archetype | Mid-to-large technology-enabled enterprise, ≥500 employees, ≥100 engineers (see Problem Statement §3.1) |
| Architecture framework | TOGAF ADM, tailored — Phases A–F are populated in this knowledge base; Phases G (Implementation Governance) and H (Change Management) are addressed operationally in [../07-governance-risk/ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md](../07-governance-risk/ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md) |

## 3. Problem-to-architecture traceability

The architecture exists to close the gap identified in the Problem Statement: knowledge workers and AI agents cannot efficiently or safely retrieve authoritative answers from fragmented, inconsistently-permissioned enterprise systems. This vision translates that business problem into an architectural response built on one non-negotiable principle carried through every subsequent phase:

> **No AI reasoning component may hold direct credentials to a source system.** All data access passes through a single, permission-enforcing retrieval layer. This is the architectural expression of the trust the rest of the business case depends on.

## 4. Statement of architecture work

Develop and govern a target architecture for an enterprise knowledge intelligence platform that:

1. Indexes heterogeneous internal knowledge sources (code, documents/wikis, structured data) behind a unified, semantically-capable retrieval layer.
2. Enforces source-system permissions at the retrieval layer, so no requester (human or AI agent) can access more than they could through the source system directly.
3. Provides a governed multi-agent reasoning layer that synthesizes cited, provenance-bearing answers, with genuine iterative evidence-gathering rather than single-pass lookup.
4. Exposes both an interactive human interface and a standards-based (MCP-aligned) machine interface for AI agent consumption.
5. Is observable, evaluable, and cost-accountable in production — not just functionally correct in a demo.

## 5. Architecture vision (target state, narrative)

By the end of the initial enterprise pilot (see [08-roadmap](../08-roadmap/MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)), an authorized user or AI agent in the pilot business unit can ask a natural-language question and receive, within single-digit seconds, a synthesized answer that:

- draws on evidence from every in-scope source system relevant to the question,
- cites the specific source of each claim,
- reflects only content that requester was already permitted to see,
- flags when sources disagree or appear stale, and
- is logged in a form a compliance reviewer can audit after the fact.

Behind that experience, the platform operates as three independently scalable service tiers (interface, retrieval/knowledge API, agent orchestration) connected by one enforced trust boundary, with an evaluation harness and observability stack that make the platform's quality and cost measurable and improvable — not merely demonstrable once.

## 6. Value proposition by stakeholder

| Stakeholder | Value delivered by target architecture |
|---|---|
| Knowledge worker | One place to ask, not ten systems to guess between |
| Engineering leadership | A way to check for prior art before funding duplicate work |
| Security/compliance | A provable, auditable access boundary for AI-mediated data access |
| AI platform team | A reusable, governed knowledge tool every future internal agent can call instead of re-solving retrieval per agent |
| Executive sponsor | A measurable productivity return and a de-risked foundation for the broader AI roadmap |

## 7. Architecture principles

| Principle | Statement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Trust-boundary isolation | Reasoning components never hold source-system credentials | Makes the security posture provable by inspection, not just by policy |
| Retrieval before generation | No answer is synthesized without grounding evidence retrieved in that request | Directly addresses the hallucination/trust risk identified in the Problem Statement |
| Evaluate before ship | No change to retrieval, prompts, or models reaches production without passing an automated evaluation gate | Converts "we tested it manually" into a repeatable quality guarantee |
| Least-exposure retrieval | The platform never surfaces content the requester couldn't already access at the source | Prevents the platform from becoming a permission-escalation path |
| Observability is not optional | Every request is traceable end-to-end, including cost | Cost and correctness must be debuggable in production, not inferred |
| Augment, don't replace, systems of record | Source systems remain authoritative; VigilRAG indexes and reasons, it does not migrate | Keeps scope bounded and avoids re-litigating unrelated system migrations |

## 8. Constraints carried into subsequent phases

- Must integrate with the sponsoring organization's existing identity provider (no new IdP).
- Must operate within existing cloud/container platform investments where feasible (see [04-solution-architecture/TECHNOLOGY_ARCHITECTURE.md](../04-solution-architecture/TECHNOLOGY_ARCHITECTURE.md)).
- Initial delivery targets a single pilot business unit, not organization-wide rollout (see [08-roadmap](../08-roadmap/MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)).
- Full detail: [../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md §9](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#9-constraints-and-assumptions).

## 9. Risks to the architecture vision itself

| Risk | Impact if unmanaged |
|---|---|
| Source content quality is inconsistent | Retrieval quality is bounded by what's indexed; garbage in, garbage out |
| Permission propagation is architecturally hard across heterogeneous sources | If under-engineered, either a security incident (over-exposure) or a broken product (over-restriction) |
| Organization treats this as a search feature rather than a governed platform | Under-invests in the trust-boundary and evaluation infrastructure that is the actual differentiator |

## 10. Approval

This vision is a draft pending Architecture Review Board sign-off before Phase B work is treated as baselined. See [../07-governance-risk/ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md](../07-governance-risk/ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md) for the governance body and approval process.
