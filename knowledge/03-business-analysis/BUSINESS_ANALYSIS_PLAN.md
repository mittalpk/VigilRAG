# Business Analysis Plan

**BABOK — Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring**
**Status:** Draft · **Version:** 1.0 · 2026-07-14

---

## 1. Purpose

Defines how business analysis work for EVIKAP will be planned, governed, and monitored — the approach, stakeholder engagement, deliverables, and governance BABOK expects to precede requirements elicitation.

## 2. Business analysis approach

**Approach selected: adaptive/iterative, not predictive.** Because the riskiest assumptions here are about AI answer quality and user trust — not implementation mechanics — requirements will be elicited in rounds tied to Lean validation checkpoints (see [../05-lean-product/PROBLEM_SOLUTION_FIT.md](../05-lean-product/PROBLEM_SOLUTION_FIT.md)) and SAFe Program Increments (see [../06-agile-delivery/PI_PLANNING_OBJECTIVES.md](../06-agile-delivery/PI_PLANNING_OBJECTIVES.md)), rather than frozen upfront in a single requirements document.

| Planning dimension | Decision |
|---|---|
| Formality | Structured but lightweight — markdown specifications in this knowledge base, not a heavyweight requirements-management tool, appropriate to a single-product initiative |
| Requirements prioritization technique | MoSCoW at the epic/feature level (see Program Backlog), WSJF at the PI-planning level (SAFe standard) |
| Elicitation techniques planned | Stakeholder interviews (pilot sponsor, source system owners), document analysis (existing systems, prior audit), workshops (requirements review with architecture board), prototyping (MVP per Lean plan) |
| Requirements verification | Peer review by AI engineering lead + traceability check against Problem Statement objectives |
| Requirements validation | Pilot user acceptance against criteria in [../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md §11](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#11-acceptance-criteria) |

## 3. Stakeholder engagement plan

See [../02-business-architecture/STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS.md](../02-business-architecture/STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS.md) for the full register. Business-analysis-specific engagement:

| Activity | Stakeholders | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements elicitation interviews | Pilot sponsor, 3–5 representative end users, 1 source system owner per source type | Once per discovery round, before each PI |
| Requirements review workshop | AI engineering lead, security engineering, architecture board delegate | Per major requirements revision |
| Backlog refinement | Product owner, delivery team | Weekly during active delivery |
| Acceptance review | Pilot sponsor, budget owner | End of each PI and at pilot exit |

## 4. Business analysis deliverables and where they live

| BABOK knowledge area | Deliverable | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring | This document | Here |
| Elicitation and Collaboration | Requirements elicitation notes (interview/workshop outputs) | To be added per round under this folder as `elicitation-log/` once discovery begins |
| Requirements Life Cycle Management | Requirements Management Plan | [REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md](REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md) |
| Strategy Analysis | Problem Statement, Business Architecture | [../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md), [../02-business-architecture](../02-business-architecture) |
| Requirements Analysis and Design Definition | Functional and Non-Functional Requirements Specifications | [FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md](FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md), [NONFUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md](NONFUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md) |
| Solution Evaluation | Acceptance criteria and success metrics | [../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md §11–12](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#11-acceptance-criteria) |

## 5. Requirements traceability approach

Every functional and non-functional requirement carries a unique ID (`FR-xxx`, `NFR-xxx`) and traces back to a Problem Statement objective and forward to the Program Backlog feature(s) that implement it. Traceability is maintained as a table inside the Requirements Management Plan and re-validated at each PI boundary — see [REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md §4](REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md#4-traceability-matrix).

## 6. Business analysis performance metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Requirements volatility (changes after baseline, per PI) | <15% of baselined requirements changed per PI, excluding planned roadmap items |
| Requirements defect rate (requirements found ambiguous/incorrect during delivery) | <10% of requirements require rework after sprint planning has started |
| Elicitation coverage | 100% of in-scope stakeholder groups from the Stakeholder Analysis interviewed at least once per major discovery round |

## 7. Assumptions and constraints on the business analysis effort

- Assumes timely access to a representative pilot business unit and its source systems (carried from [Problem Statement §9.4](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#94-risks-and-assumptions)).
- Assumes a single business analyst / AI solutions architect role covers this work initially; a dedicated BA is a scaling trigger once beyond one pilot business unit.
