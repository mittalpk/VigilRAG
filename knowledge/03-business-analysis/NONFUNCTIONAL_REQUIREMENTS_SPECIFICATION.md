# Non-Functional Requirements Specification

**BABOK — Requirements Analysis and Design Definition (Quality of Service)**
**Status:** Draft · **Version:** 1.0 · 2026-07-14
**Related:** [../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md §7](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#7-non-functional-requirements)

---

## 1. Purpose and notation

Each NFR is stated with a measurable target and a verification method, per the same testability discipline as the functional requirements.

## 2. Requirements

### NFR-001 — Scalability

**Statement:** The retrieval and orchestration services shall scale horizontally and independently to support growth from pilot scale (≤10K documents, ≤500 users) to enterprise scale (≥250K documents, ≥10K users) without architectural rework.
**Verification:** Load test at 5x and 25x pilot volume before enterprise rollout approval; no single-instance bottleneck identified in the [current audit](../EVIKAP_AUDIT.md) (e.g., the unbounded per-process cache) may persist into the scaled architecture.

### NFR-002 — Security

**Statement:** No AI reasoning component shall hold direct credentials to any source system; all data access passes through a single, permission-enforcing retrieval layer (the trust-boundary principle from [Architecture Vision §7](../01-architecture-vision/ARCHITECTURE_VISION.md#7-architecture-principles)). All inter-service communication shall be authenticated with constant-time credential comparison.
**Verification:** Static analysis confirms no source-system SDK/credential imports in the reasoning service; penetration test confirms no timing-attack vulnerability on any auth comparison.

### NFR-003 — Privacy

**Statement:** PII encountered in retrieved source content shall be identifiable and redactable in synthesized answers per configurable policy (implemented via a named PII-detection library, e.g. Microsoft Presidio, rather than ad hoc pattern matching). No source content shall be used to train or fine-tune shared models without explicit organizational consent.
**Verification:** A PII-tagged test fixture confirms redaction behavior; a model-training data-lineage check confirms no source content reaches a training pipeline without a logged consent record.

### NFR-004 — Compliance

**Statement:** The audit log (FR-008) shall retain sufficient detail to support internal compliance review and applicable external regulatory inquiry, retained per the organization's data-retention policy.
**Verification:** Compliance sign-off on audit log schema and retention period before any regulated-data source is onboarded — see [Compliance & Security Framework](../07-governance-risk/COMPLIANCE_SECURITY_FRAMEWORK.md).

### NFR-005 — Reliability

**Statement:** When a single source system is unavailable, the platform shall degrade gracefully — returning a partial, clearly-sourced answer — rather than failing the entire request.
**Verification:** Chaos test: disable one source connector, confirm the query path still returns a degraded-but-labeled response for queries not solely dependent on that source.

### NFR-006 — Performance

**Statement:** Median end-to-end query latency for a synthesized answer shall not exceed the target set during discovery (planning range: 2–6 seconds depending on query complexity), tracked per query type, not only in aggregate.
**Verification:** Production latency dashboard segmented by query complexity tier; alert on p90 breach.

### NFR-007 — Observability

**Statement:** Every request shall be traceable end-to-end across retrieval and orchestration layers, including per-call token cost, latency, and the evidence path that produced the answer, using OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions exported to a dedicated LLM observability platform (e.g., Langfuse or Arize Phoenix) rather than raw log aggregation alone.
**Verification:** A synthetic incident (intentionally broken retrieval step) is diagnosable from traces alone within a defined mean-time-to-diagnose target, without reading raw service logs.

### NFR-008 — Availability

**Statement:** The query path shall meet **99.5%** availability at MVP, progressing to **99.9%** as the platform becomes an enterprise-wide dependency.
**Verification:** Uptime monitoring against the health-probe endpoints already established as a genuine strength in the [current audit](../EVIKAP_AUDIT.md); SLO dashboard reviewed monthly.

### NFR-009 — Cost optimization

**Statement:** Query-time model routing shall balance answer quality against inference cost — lightweight models for planning/decomposition, higher-capability models reserved for final synthesis — with cost per query tracked and visible to platform owners.
**Verification:** Cost-per-query dashboard trending flat or down per unit of query volume growth, reviewed at each PI boundary.

### NFR-010 — Maintainability

**Statement:** Source connectors, retrieval logic, and agent orchestration shall be independently deployable and testable; prompt and retrieval-configuration changes shall be versioned and pass an automated evaluation gate before production rollout.
**Verification:** CI pipeline demonstrably blocks a deploy on evaluation-harness regression (closes the "no CI test gate" finding in the [audit](../EVIKAP_AUDIT.md)).

### NFR-011 — AI Quality Assurance (RAG evaluation)

**Statement:** Every change to retrieval logic, prompts, or models shall be evaluated automatically against a versioned golden dataset using a named RAG-evaluation framework (e.g., RAGAS for faithfulness/context-precision/context-recall, or an equivalent LLM-as-judge harness such as DeepEval), with results gating CI (this is the concrete mechanism behind NFR-010's "automated evaluation gate" and FR-011/FR-012's acceptance checks) and tracked as a trend in production, not just checked once at release.
**Verification:** CI blocks merge on a defined regression threshold against the prior baseline; a production dashboard shows groundedness/relevance/faithfulness trend over time, reviewed at each PI boundary alongside the cost dashboard (NFR-009).

### NFR-012 — Governance and transparency

**Statement:** The platform's AI governance posture shall be mapped to a named external standard (e.g., NIST AI Risk Management Framework or ISO/IEC 42001) rather than internal policy alone, and every production model/pipeline version shall have a current, published Model/System Card (FR-013) as the artifact of record for that mapping.
**Verification:** Annual (minimum) review confirming the governance-framework mapping is current; spot-check that a sampled production release has a Model/System Card whose eval scores match the evaluation harness's own record for that version.
