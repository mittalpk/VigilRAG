## EPIC-01: Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform

### Epic name
VigilRAG — Enterprise Vigilant Knowledge & Agentic Platform

### Business outcome hypothesis

> **For** knowledge workers and internal AI agents in [pilot business unit], **who** currently cannot efficiently or safely find authoritative answers across fragmented internal systems, **the** VigilRAG platform **is a** governed, cited, multi-source knowledge retrieval and reasoning layer **that** reduces time-to-answer and provides an auditable trust boundary for AI-mediated knowledge access, **unlike** per-system search or ungoverned direct AI access to raw systems, **our solution** enforces source permissions at retrieval time, cites every claim to its source, and evaluates its own answer quality continuously in production.

### Leading indicators (validated before full funding — see Problem/Solution Fit)

- Time-motion/survey-confirmed fragmentation cost within or above industry benchmark range for the pilot organization.
- Concierge-test evidence that users prefer cited synthesized answers over current search habits ≥50% of the time.
- Security architecture review confirms a viable permission-enforcement design for code and wiki source types.

### Lagging indicators (measured post-MVP, drive continued/expanded funding)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measured via |
|---|---|---|---|
| Median time-to-answer | Discovery-phase baseline (to be measured) | ≥40% reduction | Query-log + survey |
| Weekly active users (% of pilot population) | 0 | ≥60% | Product analytics |
| Groundedness rate | N/A | ≥90% | Evaluation harness |
| Cost per query | N/A | Trending flat/down as volume grows | Observability dashboard |
| Zero critical security/audit findings | N/A | Zero, ongoing | Periodic access-control audit |

### Non-functional outcomes required regardless of business metrics

Per [Architecture Vision §7](../01-architecture-vision/ARCHITECTURE_VISION.md#7-architecture-principles): the trust boundary between reasoning and data access must hold at every delivery increment. This is treated as a **non-negotiable Definition of Done for the epic**, not a feature that can be traded off against velocity.

## Lean business case

### Cost

| Item | Estimate basis |
|---|---|
| Platform/AI engineering team (2–4 FTE) for MVP + fast-follow PIs | See [Program Backlog](PROGRAM_BACKLOG.md) sizing |
| Cloud infrastructure (compute, vector/relational storage, cache, observability) | Scales with pilot volume; modeled in [Technology Architecture](../04-solution-architecture/TECHNOLOGY_ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| LLM inference cost | Modeled via NFR-009 cost-per-query tracking from day one |

### Benefit

Per [Problem Statement §5.4](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#54-expected-roi): illustrative planning estimate of **$500K–$1M annual recovered productivity value** for a ~1,000-person pilot-scale population, at a conservative 20% time-lost reduction against industry-benchmark cost ranges — explicitly flagged as **directional, not validated**, pending the discovery-phase baseline in [Problem/Solution Fit §2](../05-lean-product/PROBLEM_SOLUTION_FIT.md#2-problem-validation-is-the-problem-real-here-at-this-magnitude).

### Staged funding gates (Lean Startup discipline applied to SAFe funding)

```
Gate 0 (Problem/Solution Fit)  -> funds discovery + concierge test only, ~6 weeks, minimal spend
Gate 1 (MVP)                   -> funds PI-1 (MVP scope per MVP_DEFINITION.md) only if Gate 0 criteria pass
Gate 2 (Pilot expansion)       -> funds PI-2+ (full functional requirements) only if MVP success criteria pass
Gate 3 (Enterprise rollout)    -> funds organization-wide scaling only if pilot lagging indicators hit target
```

Funding is **not** committed in full at epic approval — each gate requires the prior gate's evidence, consistent with the Lean Canvas's explicit treatment of unvalidated assumptions.

### WSJF epic-level prioritization inputs

| Factor | Rating (1–10) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| User/business value | 8 | Directly addresses a widely-felt, if not yet locally-validated, productivity and AI-governance problem |
| Time criticality | 7 | AI-agent adoption pressure is active now; delaying increases the risk of ungoverned agent access becoming entrenched practice |
| Risk reduction / opportunity enablement | 9 | Unblocks the organization's broader AI-agent roadmap by resolving the governance blocker described in [Problem Statement §2.2](../PRODUCT_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md#22-why-the-problem-exists-today) |
| Job size | Large (multi-PI) | See [Program Backlog](PROGRAM_BACKLOG.md) for feature-level sizing |

### Epic owner and approval

**Epic owner:** AI Solutions Architect (accountable for technical hypothesis)
**Business owner:** Budget owner per [Stakeholder Analysis](../02-business-architecture/STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS.md)
**Approval to proceed past each gate:** per the RACI in [Stakeholder Analysis §4](../02-business-architecture/STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS.md#4-raci-summary-key-decisions)
