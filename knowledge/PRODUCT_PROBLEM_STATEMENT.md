## 1. Executive Summary

Enterprise organizations do not suffer from a shortage of information. They suffer from an inability to locate, trust, and act on the information they already own. Institutional knowledge — architecture decisions, policy documents, operational runbooks, database schemas, and internal wikis — accumulates across dozens of disconnected systems as an organization grows. Each system has its own access model, its own search index (or none), and its own audience. The result is a workforce that spends a material fraction of every working day re-discovering facts the organization already knows, and a growing population of AI coding and support agents that cannot be trusted with access to that knowledge because no safe, unified, auditable retrieval layer exists.

**VigilRAG** is proposed as an enterprise knowledge intelligence platform: a unified, secure, LLM-ready retrieval and reasoning layer that sits in front of an organization's code repositories, policy and process documentation, structured data sources, and internal wikis. Rather than replacing existing systems of record, VigilRAG indexes them, reasons over them with a governed multi-agent AI layer, and exposes a single, auditable, permission-aware interface that both human users and downstream AI agents can query with confidence in the answer's provenance.

**Vision:** within 18 months of general availability, VigilRAG should be the default first place a knowledge worker or an AI coding/support agent looks for an authoritative answer inside a mid-to-large enterprise, measurably reducing time-to-answer, reducing duplicated work, and providing the trust and audit layer that lets the organization safely extend AI agents into higher-value, higher-risk workflows.

**Expected business impact:** a 30–50% reduction in time spent searching for internal information among target user populations, a measurable reduction in duplicated engineering and support effort caused by "unknown unknowns" (existing solutions/decisions that go unfound and get rebuilt), and a governed foundation that de-risks the organization's broader AI-agent adoption roadmap by giving every agent a single, permissioned, auditable knowledge interface instead of ad hoc, ungoverned access to raw systems.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The problem, stated plainly

Knowledge workers and the AI systems now being deployed alongside them cannot efficiently or safely find authoritative answers to questions the organization has already answered, because that knowledge is fragmented across systems that were never designed to be queried together, are inconsistently permissioned, and have no shared notion of "this is the current, trusted answer."

### 2.2 Why the problem exists today

- **Organic system sprawl.** Code lives in one or more source control platforms; policy and process documentation lives in a wiki or document management system; operational and customer data lives in relational databases and data warehouses; team knowledge lives in chat history and ticketing systems. Each was adopted independently, by different teams, at different times, with no shared retrieval contract.
- **Search was solved locally, not organizationally.** Most of these systems have adequate *local* search (search within the wiki, search within the repo) but no system indexes across all of them with a consistent relevance model, so a user must know *which system* holds the answer before they can search for it.
- **Access control was designed for humans clicking through a UI, not for programmatic or AI-driven retrieval.** Permission models differ per system (repo-level, space-level, table-level, folder-level), which makes it operationally risky to expose these systems directly to an AI agent — the agent would need to independently understand and respect every system's authorization model.
- **Documentation decays faster than it is written.** Without a mechanism that surfaces staleness or conflicting answers, outdated wiki pages and superseded design docs remain discoverable and are frequently mistaken for current guidance.
- **AI agent adoption has outpaced knowledge governance.** Organizations are increasingly deploying LLM-based coding assistants, support copilots, and internal chatbots, but are doing so either with no access to internal knowledge (limiting their usefulness) or with broad, poorly-audited access to raw systems (creating a governance and data-leakage risk). Neither posture is sustainable.

### 2.3 Quantifying the business impact

Industry research on knowledge-worker productivity consistently identifies information search and re-discovery as one of the largest sources of avoidable lost time in knowledge-intensive organizations:

| Benchmark (industry research, directional ranges) | Reported impact |
|---|---|
| Time spent searching for or recreating information | Commonly cited in the range of **1.5–2.5 hours per knowledge worker per day** (McKinsey Global Institute; IDC knowledge-worker productivity studies) |
| Annual cost of inefficient knowledge search, per 1,000 knowledge workers | Commonly cited in the range of **$2.5M–$5M annually**, driven by fully-loaded labor cost of lost search time |
| Engineering rework caused by undiscovered prior work (duplicate services, re-litigated architecture decisions) | Reported by engineering-productivity research (e.g., DORA, internal platform-engineering studies) as a top-3 source of avoidable cycle-time loss in organizations above ~200 engineers |
| Onboarding time-to-productivity for new technical hires | Frequently cited as **60–90 days** to reach baseline productivity, with "finding the right internal documentation" repeatedly identified as a top blocker in exit/onboarding surveys |

These figures should be treated as **directional industry benchmarks to be validated against the sponsoring organization's own data during discovery**, not as claims specific to any single customer. Validating them (via a time-motion study or engineering-survey baseline) is itself an early deliverable of the engagement (see Section 12, Operational Metrics).

### 2.4 Pain points by population

| Population | Pain point |
|---|---|
| Individual contributors (engineers, analysts, support staff) | Cannot determine which of several similarly-named documents or repos is current; must interrupt colleagues (Slack, meetings) to get answers that should be self-service |
| Engineering leads | Cannot verify whether a proposed solution has already been built, evaluated, or rejected elsewhere in the organization before approving new work |
| New hires | Face a steep, undocumented "tribal knowledge" ramp because the organization's real knowledge lives in people's heads and scattered systems, not in one discoverable place |
| Compliance / security teams | Cannot answer "who can see what" across systems with confidence, and cannot audit what an AI agent accessed when it produced an answer |
| Platform / AI enablement teams | Cannot safely give internal AI agents access to enterprise knowledge without either over-restricting them (low value) or over-exposing raw systems (unacceptable risk) |
| Executive sponsors | Cannot quantify how much organizational knowledge debt is costing the business, because there is no instrumented system through which that cost becomes visible |

### 2.5 Why existing solutions are insufficient

- **Per-system search (GitHub code search, Confluence search, wiki search)** solves retrieval within one silo and provides no cross-system relevance ranking, no unified permission model, and no way to reconcile contradictory answers across systems.
- **General enterprise search products** (legacy enterprise search appliances, generic "search everything" connectors) typically index for keyword retrieval, not semantic understanding, and were not designed with an LLM or AI-agent consumer in mind — they return ranked document lists, not synthesized, cited, trustworthy answers.
- **Point AI chatbots bolted onto a single source** (e.g., "chat with our wiki") solve one silo at a time and reproduce the fragmentation problem one silo later — a user still needs to know which chatbot to ask.
- **Ungoverned direct LLM access to raw systems** (an agent with a GitHub token and a database credential) is fast to prototype but fails governance, security, and audit review the moment it is proposed for production use in a regulated or security-conscious enterprise, because there is no policy enforcement point between the model and the data.

None of these approaches provide the combination VigilRAG is scoped to deliver: **cross-source semantic retrieval, a single governed trust boundary between AI reasoning and data access, and an auditable answer with provenance** — synthesized for both human and machine consumers.

## 3. Business Context

### 3.1 Industry background

The target industry context is **mid-to-large technology-enabled enterprises** (software companies, and technology-heavy divisions of non-software enterprises — financial services, healthcare technology, telecommunications) with more than approximately 500 employees and more than approximately 100 engineers, where the number and diversity of internal knowledge systems has already exceeded what any single team can navigate from memory. This is also, not coincidentally, the population of organizations now actively evaluating internal AI-agent deployment and confronting knowledge-governance questions for the first time.

### 3.2 Current business processes

Today, an employee seeking an authoritative answer typically: (1) guesses which system is most likely to contain it, (2) searches that system with keyword search, (3) fails to find a conclusive answer a meaningful fraction of the time, and (4) falls back to asking a colleague directly — consuming that colleague's time as an unscheduled, un-instrumented "knowledge API call." This process is not documented anywhere because it is informal; it is discovered only through observation (shadowing, surveys, support-ticket analysis of "where do I find X" questions).

### 3.3 Existing challenges

- No single system of record for "what is currently true" when multiple systems disagree or overlap.
- No instrumented visibility into how much time or rework this fragmentation actually costs — the problem is chronically under-prioritized because it has never been measured.
- Growing pressure to deploy AI coding assistants and support agents that need exactly this cross-system knowledge to be useful, creating urgency that did not exist three years ago.
- Security and compliance functions increasingly required to answer "what data can this AI agent see, and can you prove it" — a question current tooling cannot answer.

### 3.4 Market trends driving the need for AI

- **LLM-native retrieval (RAG) has matured** from research technique to standard enterprise pattern, with mainstream vector database, embedding, and orchestration tooling now production-grade.
- **Enterprise AI agent adoption is accelerating** (coding assistants, support copilots, internal operations agents), and every one of them needs a safe knowledge interface — creating platform-level, not point-solution-level, demand.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar standards are emerging** as the expected integration surface for exposing enterprise systems to AI agents, shifting the market away from bespoke point integrations toward a "knowledge platform with a standard interface" model — which is the category VigilRAG is positioned to serve.
- **Regulatory and governance scrutiny of AI systems is increasing** (EU AI Act, sector-specific guidance, internal enterprise AI governance boards), raising the bar for any AI system with access to internal data to demonstrate auditability, access control, and provenance — a bar most current internal AI prototypes do not meet.

## 4. Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder group | Representative roles | Primary interest | Success criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Business stakeholders** | VP Engineering, Chief of Staff, Head of Operations | Reduce lost productivity and rework cost; demonstrate measurable ROI on AI investment | Measurable, attributable reduction in time-to-answer and rework; positive ROI within the defined evaluation window |
| **Technical stakeholders** | Enterprise architects, platform engineering leads, security engineering | A retrieval and agent layer that is secure-by-design, observable, and does not create new attack surface or data-leakage risk | Passes architecture and security review; integrates with existing IAM/SSO; produces auditable access logs |
| **End users — knowledge workers** | Engineers, analysts, support staff | Fast, trustworthy answers without needing to know which system holds them | Reduced time-to-answer; high perceived answer trustworthiness; low false-answer rate |
| **End users — AI agent consumers** | Internal AI coding assistants, support copilots (machine consumers via API/MCP) | A single, permissioned, well-documented interface to enterprise knowledge | Reliable API/tool contract; correct, provenance-cited responses; predictable latency |
| **Decision makers** | CTO / Head of AI Platform, budget owner | Confidence that this investment reduces organizational risk while enabling the broader AI roadmap, at a justified cost | Clear before/after metrics; a governed foundation the rest of the AI roadmap can build on without re-litigating security posture |
| **Compliance / security / legal** | CISO office, data governance | Provable access control, data residency, and auditability for any system with access to internal and potentially regulated data | Full access audit trail; enforced least-privilege; demonstrable compliance with data-handling policy |
| **Delivery / engineering teams building the product** | Product manager, AI/ML engineers, platform engineers | A well-scoped, buildable, phased roadmap with clear acceptance criteria | Requirements are unambiguous and testable; scope is stable enough to plan sprints/PI increments against |

## 5. Business Objectives

### 5.1 Strategic goals

1. Establish a single, governed knowledge retrieval layer that becomes the default integration point for both human search and AI-agent tool use across the organization's internal knowledge.
2. Reduce measurable time-to-answer and duplicated-work costs associated with information fragmentation.
3. Provide the security and audit foundation that unblocks broader, higher-value AI agent adoption (coding agents, support agents, operational agents) by giving the organization a defensible answer to "what can your AI agents see, and how do you know."

### 5.2 Measurable business outcomes

- Reduce median time-to-authoritative-answer for in-scope query types by **≥40%** versus the pre-implementation baseline, measured via user survey and query-log analysis.
- Reduce the incidence of duplicated engineering effort attributable to undiscovered prior work by a measurable, tracked percentage (baseline to be established during discovery; target set once baseline is known).
- Achieve **≥60% weekly active adoption** among the target initial user population (a defined pilot organization or business unit) within two quarters of general availability.
- Achieve zero critical or high-severity security/audit findings related to unauthorized data exposure through the platform, verified via periodic access-control audit.

### 5.3 KPIs and success metrics (summary — see Section 12 for full detail)

- Time-to-answer (median, p90)
- Answer trustworthiness / groundedness rate
- Weekly/monthly active users and query volume
- Duplicate-work incidents avoided (tracked qualitatively via user-reported "this saved me from rebuilding X")
- Cost per query (inference + infrastructure) trending down over time
- Mean time to detect and remediate an access-control or provenance defect

### 5.4 Expected ROI

Using the industry-benchmark cost-of-search figures in Section 2.3 as a starting model (to be replaced with the sponsoring organization's validated baseline during discovery): for an organization of approximately 1,000 knowledge workers, even a conservative 20% reduction in time lost to information search — against a benchmark cost range of $2.5M–$5M annually — represents an estimated **$500K–$1M in annual recovered productivity value**, before accounting for reduced engineering rework or the risk-reduction value of a governed AI-agent knowledge interface. This estimate should be treated as an illustrative planning input, formally validated in the business case developed alongside the discovery-phase baseline measurement (see Section 12.3).

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Core product capabilities

- **Unified query interface** — a single API and UI through which a user or AI agent can ask a natural-language question and receive a synthesized, cited answer drawn from any in-scope source.
- **Cross-source semantic retrieval** — retrieval that understands meaning and intent, not only keyword overlap, across code repositories, structured data sources, and document/wiki content.
- **Provenance and citation** — every synthesized answer must cite the specific source document, code file, or record it was derived from, with a link back to the system of record.
- **Multi-agent reasoning layer** — an orchestration layer capable of decomposing a complex question into sub-queries across multiple sources, executing them, and synthesizing a single coherent answer, with genuine iterative refinement when initial evidence is insufficient (not a single-pass lookup dressed as reasoning).
- **Freshness and conflict signaling** — the ability to flag when retrieved sources disagree or when the most relevant source appears stale, rather than silently presenting one as authoritative.
- **Permission-aware retrieval** — results and synthesized answers must respect the requesting user's or agent's existing access permissions in each underlying source system; the platform must never surface content the requester could not already access directly.

### 6.2 User workflows

1. **Ask a question (human, interactive).** A user submits a natural-language query via UI or chat integration and receives a synthesized answer with citations and a confidence/freshness indicator, with the ability to drill into source documents.
2. **Ask a question (machine, programmatic/MCP).** An internal AI agent calls the platform's query tool/API as part of its own reasoning loop and receives a structured, citation-bearing response suitable for further LLM consumption.
3. **Source registration and indexing.** A platform administrator registers a new knowledge source (repository, wiki space, database schema, document store), which the platform indexes on a defined refresh cadence.
4. **Access and audit review.** A security or compliance stakeholder reviews an audit log of what was queried, by whom (human or agent identity), and which underlying sources and records contributed to each answer.
5. **Feedback and correction loop.** A user flags an answer as incorrect, outdated, or ungrounded, feeding an evaluation and continuous-improvement pipeline.

### 6.3 AI-assisted features

- Natural-language question answering grounded in retrieved evidence (retrieval-augmented generation).
- Multi-step agentic query decomposition and evidence-gathering for questions that span multiple sources.
- Automatic summarization of long or multiple source documents into a synthesized answer.
- Proactive staleness/conflict detection across sources addressing the same topic.
- (Roadmap) Predictive surfacing of relevant knowledge based on a user's current work context (e.g., the file or ticket they have open).

### 6.4 Integration requirements

- Source connectors for code repositories (e.g., GitHub/GitLab), document/wiki platforms (e.g., Confluence-class systems), structured data sources (relational databases, data warehouses), and object/blob storage.
- Enterprise identity integration (SSO/OIDC) for both human users and service-identity-based agent access.
- A standards-based tool/agent interface (e.g., Model Context Protocol) so external and internal AI agents can consume the platform as a governed tool rather than requiring bespoke per-agent integration.
- Outbound integration into existing chat platforms (e.g., Slack/Teams) for interactive human use.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Scalability** | Must support indexing and query load for organizations from pilot scale (single team, low tens of thousands of documents/records) up to enterprise scale (hundreds of thousands of documents, tens of thousands of users) without architectural rework; retrieval and orchestration services must scale horizontally and independently |
| **Security** | All inter-service communication authenticated; no AI reasoning component may hold direct credentials to underlying data sources — all data access must pass through a governed, permission-enforcing retrieval layer (trust-boundary isolation) |
| **Privacy** | Personally identifiable information encountered in source content must be identifiable and redactable in synthesized answers per configurable policy; no source content may be used to train or fine-tune shared models without explicit organizational consent |
| **Compliance** | Full auditability of query, retrieval, and access events sufficient to support internal compliance review and, where applicable, external regulatory inquiry (e.g., data-access provenance under EU AI Act–aligned governance expectations) |
| **Reliability** | Defined availability target for the query path (see Availability below); graceful degradation (partial answers with clear sourcing) preferred over hard failure when a single source is unavailable |
| **Performance** | Median end-to-end query latency target under a defined threshold (to be set during discovery, target range 2–6 seconds for synthesized answers depending on query complexity); performance must be monitored per query type, not only in aggregate |
| **Observability** | Full request tracing across retrieval and agent orchestration layers, including per-call token cost, latency, and evidence path, sufficient to debug both correctness and cost issues in production |
| **Availability** | Target **99.5%** availability for the query path at minimum viable product, progressing to **99.9%** as the platform moves from pilot to enterprise-wide dependency |
| **Cost optimization** | Query-time model routing must balance answer quality against inference cost (e.g., lightweight models for retrieval/planning, higher-capability models reserved for final synthesis); cost per query must be tracked and visible to platform owners |
| **Maintainability** | Source connectors, retrieval logic, and agent orchestration must be independently deployable and testable; prompt and retrieval-configuration changes must be versioned and evaluated in CI before production rollout |

---

## 8. AI Solution Vision

### 8.1 Why AI is the appropriate solution

This is fundamentally a problem of **unstructured, heterogeneous meaning at scale** — the same underlying question can be phrased dozens of ways, the same fact can live in differently-worded documents across systems, and the value is not in returning a list of possibly-relevant links but in synthesizing a single, trustworthy, cited answer. This is precisely the class of problem large language models, paired with retrieval grounding, are suited to: they can normalize varied phrasing, reason across retrieved evidence, and produce a coherent synthesized response — provided that response remains strictly grounded in retrieved, cited evidence rather than the model's unconstrained prior knowledge. A traditional keyword-search-and-link-list approach cannot deliver the synthesis and cross-source reasoning that is the actual point of this product.

### 8.2 Expected AI capabilities

- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** as the grounding mechanism for all synthesized answers — embeddings-based semantic retrieval combined with keyword/hybrid search and cross-encoder reranking, over chunked, source-attributed content, backed by a vector store chosen for MVP simplicity (pgvector) with an explicit, evidence-based graduation path to a dedicated vector database as scale requires.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — a planning agent that decomposes complex questions, specialist retrieval agents/tools per source type, and a synthesis stage that composes a final answer with citations; genuinely iterative, re-querying when initial evidence is insufficient rather than always returning a single-pass result.
- **Model routing** — smaller/faster models for query planning and decomposition, larger/higher-capability models reserved for final answer synthesis, with cost and latency tracked per routing decision.
- **Evaluation-driven quality management** — an automated evaluation harness (RAGAS as the primary framework, faithfulness/context-precision/context-recall scored against a maintained golden dataset, with DeepEval or an equivalent LLM-as-judge as a fallback) gating any change to retrieval logic, prompts, or models before production rollout.
- **Guardrails** — prompt-injection defense on retrieved content and structured output validation before any answer is delivered, plus PII detection/redaction, so the system's expanded reach into internal knowledge doesn't become a new attack surface.
- **AI governance and transparency** — a published Model/System Card per deployed pipeline version, mapped to an external standard (NIST AI RMF or ISO/IEC 42001) rather than internal policy alone, so "what can your AI agents see, and how do you know it's correct" has a documented, auditable answer.
- **(Roadmap) Predictive/contextual retrieval** — surfacing relevant knowledge proactively based on a user's current task context, and **(roadmap) knowledge-graph-based reasoning** — a Neo4j-backed GraphRAG pattern layered on top of, not instead of, the vector retrieval above — for questions that depend on relationships between entities (e.g., "which services depend on this database schema") rather than on document similarity alone.

### 8.3 Opportunities for automation and decision support

- Reducing human-to-human interruption for routine "where do I find X" questions, freeing subject-matter experts for higher-value work.
- Giving engineering leads a decision-support tool to check for prior art before approving new build effort.
- Giving AI coding and support agents a safe, governed knowledge interface, extending their usefulness without extending their raw data access — directly enabling the organization's broader AI-agent roadmap rather than competing with it.
- Providing compliance and security teams a queryable audit trail of AI-mediated knowledge access, turning AI governance from a manual policy exercise into an instrumented, verifiable system property.

---

## 9. Constraints and Assumptions

### 9.1 Business constraints

- Initial delivery is assumed to target a defined pilot business unit or team before organization-wide rollout; budget and staffing for the full enterprise rollout are contingent on pilot-phase results against the KPIs in Section 5.
- The platform must integrate with, not replace, existing systems of record — no source system migration is in scope.

### 9.2 Technical constraints

- Must operate within the sponsoring organization's existing cloud and identity infrastructure (no requirement to introduce a new cloud provider or identity system).
- Must respect existing per-source rate limits and API quotas (e.g., source code hosting platform API limits) without degrading those systems for their existing users.
- Initial source connector scope is limited to the source types explicitly listed in Section 6.4; additional connector types are roadmap items, not MVP scope.

### 9.3 Regulatory considerations

- Any source content containing regulated data (PII, PHI, financial records, depending on industry vertical) must be identified during source registration and handled per the organization's existing data-classification policy; the platform must not create a new, less-governed path to regulated data than already exists.
- Audit logging requirements must be sufficient to support the organization's applicable regulatory framework (which will vary by industry vertical and geography and must be confirmed during discovery).

### 9.4 Risks and assumptions

| Item | Type | Description | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source data quality is inconsistent or poorly maintained | Risk | Retrieval quality is bounded by source content quality; stale or contradictory source documents will produce stale or contradictory answers | Freshness/conflict signaling (Section 6.1); source-owner feedback loop to flag and correct low-quality source content |
| User trust in AI-synthesized answers | Risk | Users may over-trust an authoritative-sounding but incorrect answer ("automation bias"), or under-trust the system after an early bad answer and abandon it | Mandatory citation-to-source on every answer; visible confidence/freshness indicators; a feedback/correction loop instrumented from day one |
| Permission-model complexity across heterogeneous sources | Risk | Incorrectly propagating source permissions could cause either over-exposure (security incident) or under-exposure (broken product) | Permission enforcement is treated as a hard architectural requirement (Section 7, Security), independently tested per source connector before that connector is enabled in production |
| Organizational assumption: sponsoring business unit will provide representative source access for a pilot | Assumption | Discovery and MVP scoping assume timely access to a representative slice of real (not synthetic) source systems | To be confirmed as an entry criterion before delivery planning begins |
| Cost assumption: LLM inference cost trends favorable | Assumption | Business case in Section 5.4 assumes continuation of the current trend of declining per-token inference cost | Model routing and cost observability (Section 7) are designed explicitly to manage this risk regardless of how the trend evolves |

---

## 10. Scope Definition

### 10.1 In scope (initial delivery)

- Unified query interface (UI + API) for natural-language questions across registered sources.
- Source connectors for: code repositories, wiki/document platforms, and structured data sources with schema-level retrieval.
- Retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid (semantic + keyword) search and citation-backed synthesis.
- A genuinely iterative multi-agent orchestration layer (planning, evidence-gathering, synthesis) with an enforced iteration/refinement loop.
- Permission-aware retrieval respecting existing source-system access controls.
- An evaluation harness and CI gate for retrieval/prompt/model changes.
- LLM observability (cost, latency, trace) for the query and orchestration path.
- Enterprise SSO integration and role-appropriate access for both human and service-identity (agent) consumers.
- A standards-based (e.g., MCP) tool interface for external/internal AI agent consumption.
- Audit logging of query, retrieval, and access events.

### 10.2 Out of scope (initial delivery)

- Migrating or replacing any existing source system.
- Write-back capability (the platform is retrieval/reasoning only in this phase; it does not modify source systems).
- Full knowledge-graph-based reasoning (explicitly deferred to roadmap, Section 10.3).
- Multi-tenant SaaS delivery to external customers (initial delivery is single-organization/internal deployment; multi-tenancy is a roadmap item once product-market fit within one organization is demonstrated).
- Predictive/proactive context-aware surfacing of knowledge (roadmap item).
- Kubernetes-based deployment (initial delivery targets the organization's existing managed container platform; Kubernetes portability is a roadmap item if multi-environment or multi-cloud delivery becomes a requirement).

### 10.3 Future roadmap

- **Near-term:** knowledge-graph-based relational reasoning; human-in-the-loop approval workflows as a precursor to any future write-back capability; expanded source connector library (ticketing systems, chat history, CI/CD systems).
- **Mid-term:** multi-tenancy for delivery as a platform across multiple business units or, longer-term, as an externally licensable product; proactive/contextual knowledge surfacing integrated into developer and support tooling.
- **Long-term:** predictive decision support (e.g., flagging likely-duplicate work at proposal time, not just at query time); expansion into cross-organization benchmarking of knowledge-fragmentation cost as a value-add analytics layer.

---

## 11. Acceptance Criteria

### 11.1 Business acceptance criteria

- Demonstrated, measured reduction in median time-to-answer for the pilot user population against the pre-implementation baseline (target: ≥40%, per Section 5.2).
- Pilot business unit sponsor formally attests the platform materially reduced dependence on ad hoc, person-to-person knowledge lookup for in-scope query types.
- A validated business case (actual pilot-measured ROI, superseding the illustrative estimate in Section 5.4) is presented to the budget owner before enterprise-wide rollout is approved.

### 11.2 Technical acceptance criteria

- Passes enterprise architecture and security review, including verification that no AI reasoning component holds direct credentials to underlying data sources (trust-boundary requirement, Section 7).
- Demonstrates permission-aware retrieval correctness under a defined test matrix (a user/agent must never receive content they could not already access directly in the source system).
- CI pipeline blocks deployment on failing tests, including evaluation-harness quality gates for retrieval/prompt/model changes.
- Full request tracing is operational and demonstrably usable to diagnose a synthetic incident (e.g., an intentionally injected retrieval failure) within a defined mean-time-to-diagnose target.
- Meets the availability, latency, and cost-per-query targets defined in Section 7 under representative pilot load.

### 11.3 AI performance criteria

- Groundedness rate (proportion of answer claims traceable to a cited source) meets or exceeds a defined threshold (target: ≥90% on the golden evaluation dataset) before general availability.
- Retrieval relevance (top-k retrieved evidence actually relevant to the query, measured against the golden dataset) meets or exceeds a defined threshold, tracked continuously in production via the evaluation harness.
- Agent orchestration demonstrates genuine iterative behavior on the evaluation dataset's multi-hop question subset (i.e., measurably outperforms a single-pass baseline on questions requiring evidence from more than one source).
- A maintained prompt-injection fixture suite is blocked or neutralized by the guardrails layer before any answer reaches a caller.
- No regression on any evaluation-harness metric is permitted to reach production without an explicit, documented sign-off exception.

- System availability against the target defined in Section 7.
- Mean time to detect and remediate access-control or provenance defects.
- **Baseline measurement deliverable:** a discovery-phase time-motion or survey-based measurement of the sponsoring organization's actual current time-to-answer and rework cost, replacing the illustrative industry benchmarks in Section 2.3 with organization-specific figures before the business case is finalized.

### 12.4 User adoption metrics

- Weekly and monthly active users (human) and active service identities (AI agents) as a percentage of the target population.
- Query volume trend and query diversity (breadth of question types being asked, as a proxy for trust and habitual use).
- Net Promoter Score or equivalent qualitative satisfaction measure among the pilot user population.
- Answer-feedback engagement rate (proportion of answers receiving explicit positive/negative feedback), used both as an adoption signal and as evaluation-harness training input.

## 13. High-Level Product Vision

VigilRAG is envisioned as an **enterprise knowledge intelligence platform**, deployed as a governed layer between an organization's fragmented systems of record and the humans and AI agents that need to reason over them. It is not a search engine, and it is not a chatbot bolted onto a single wiki — it is the trust and reasoning layer an enterprise needs before it can safely and effectively extend AI agents into knowledge-intensive work at scale.

For enterprise customers, the product's value proposition is direct: **stop paying, in lost time and duplicated effort, for knowledge the organization already has, and stop choosing between AI agents that are useful because they're ungoverned and AI agents that are governed because they're useless.** VigilRAG is designed to remove that tradeoff — delivering cross-source semantic retrieval and multi-agent reasoning with the permission enforcement, audit trail, and provenance that make it safe to deploy broadly, and the evaluation and observability discipline that make it possible to operate and improve responsibly over time.

Success for this product is measured not by the sophistication of its AI architecture in isolation, but by whether it durably changes how a real organization finds and trusts its own knowledge — fewer interrupted colleagues, less rebuilt work, faster onboarding, and a defensible answer, at any time, to the question every AI-adopting enterprise now has to answer: *what can your AI agents see, and how do you know it's correct.*
