# EVIKAP — Enterprise Knowledge Base

This folder is the single source of truth for EVIKAP's business and solution architecture rationale. It is organized around four complementary methodologies, each covering the questions the others don't:

- **TOGAF** — why the architecture exists and how it's governed (`01-architecture-vision`, `02-business-architecture`, `04-solution-architecture`, `07-governance-risk`, `08-roadmap`)
- **BABOK** — what the requirements actually are and how they were elicited (`03-business-analysis`)
- **Lean Product Development** — whether the problem/solution pairing is validated before committing engineering investment (`05-lean-product`)
- **SAFe** — how validated scope becomes funded, sequenced delivery work (`06-agile-delivery`)

## Current-state vs. target-state documents

Most of this folder describes a **target** state — what the architecture, requirements, and delivery plan should become. Two documents instead describe **as-is** reality and anchor everything else against it:

- [EVIKAP_AUDIT.md](EVIKAP_AUDIT.md) — the technical audit of what the system actually does today; the risk baseline for `07-governance-risk` and the gap baseline for `08-roadmap`.
- [04-solution-architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](04-solution-architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the as-built system architecture description, a companion to (not a replacement for) the target-state `DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`/`APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`/`TECHNOLOGY_ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same folder.

Everything in this knowledge base, including these two, lives under `knowledge/` — there is no separate `docs/` folder; superseded material that nothing here references lives outside version control in the untracked `.doc/` archive instead of being deleted outright.

## Conventions

- Every document is a living artifact — update it as decisions change, don't fork a v2 file.
- Cross-references use relative links so this folder is portable if relocated.
- Where a document makes a numeric claim (cost, ROI, benchmark), it is flagged as either **validated** (measured from this organization's own data) or **directional** (industry benchmark pending validation) — never presented as validated fact when it isn't.
